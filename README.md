# StaffManagementSystem - UPDATED
OOP EXAM - Sirma Academy

##Code review<br /> 

The menu is fully updated and now it accepts splitted by space array, consisting different commands, that you can work with. You can find the execute function in the "Manager" class.<br /> 
-Search function added(you can search by name,department,id)<br /> 
-Auto-increment problem is fixed for the id of the staff members.<br /> 
-Firing a staff member doesn't delete them from the system, however it flags them as "Fired".<br /> 
-User information is stored in a JSON file(writer and reader functions). <br />
